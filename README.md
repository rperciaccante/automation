  |--> RV Water Controller
  |        Unfortunately, this is a project I needed, more than wanted.  I experienced
  |          a leaky water control panel in my RV that caused significant damage to the
  |          wood flooring.  This project buids a device that monitors for the presence
  |          of water or excessive humidity and shuts off a water valve and triggers an
  |          alert.  Conditions and alarm state are displayed on an LCD panel.
