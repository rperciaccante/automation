Home Automation Projects

This repo contains projects I have worked on related to home/RV automation interests.

Generic Components/ - Components I have put together for various uses
- esphome_secure_base_config.yaml
  This is a base configuration for ESPHome based projects with a focus
  on being secure by default and easy to modify.  

RV Automation/ - Contains configurations for projects used in my RV
- RV Water Controller
  Unfortunately, this is a project I needed, more than wanted.  I experienced
  a leaky water control panel in my RV that caused significant damage to the
  wood flooring.  This project buids a device that monitors for the presence
  of water or excessive humidity and shuts off a water valve and triggers an
  alert.  Conditions and alarm state are displayed on an LCD panel.
